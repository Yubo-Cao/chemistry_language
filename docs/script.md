I want to tell you about Chemistry Language, which helps you solve chemistry problems.

It works like other programming languages but takes significant digits into account. It automatically calculates and
rounds the results to the correct number of significant digits.

```ch
print(1.2345 + 1.2) ps: adding takes least decimal places
print(2.0 * 3.24) ps: multiplying takes least sig figs
print(2.0^3) ps: exponents are like repeated multiplication
```

It also has a few built-in functions:

```ch
print(log(100)) ps: log base 2 by default
print(log10(100)) ps: log base 10
```
